<h1> <b><i> What's The Difference Between Ladybugs & Asian Beetles? </i></b> </h1>
        <p> Ladybugs have round bodies, red wings, and some black spots. They are harmless insects that are often believed to bring good luck. They also do not travel in groups or look to enter places to get warm. They don't do any damage to crops or bite. When it is warm out, they look to find shelter inside homes because they know the colder weather is coming in large groups. Asian beetles, on the other hand, have few spots to none. <i>Asian Lady Beetles</i> also come in a variety of colors ranging from orange to black - - some don't even have the signature <span id="M"> 'M'</span> on their thorax.
</p>
        <p>
          Luckily, ladybugs are not an invasive species here in North America. They have many beneficial uses and are welcomed in many gardens. Unfortunately, Asian lady beetles are an <span id="invasivespecies"> invasive species</span>. They wreak havoc on many homeowners, showing up by the dozens on the outside of the home. Both the <i> Six Spotted Ladybird </i> (Ladybug) and <i>The Asian Lady Beetles</i> are nonnative species, introduced between 100 and 150 years ago.

          In the 1870s, the first successful introduction of an insect predator saved the orange industry. Since the agent was a ladybug, it was thought that naturally ladybird beetles would be good control agents. There were some successes, with the <i>Multicolored Asian Lady Beetle</i> providing some control of aphids in tree cropping systems. Small releases were made across the US, between the 1920s and 1980s, and it was thought to be a species that didn’t easily establish. However, in the 1988, someone running a mercury vapor light in <b>Abita Springs, Louisiana</b> (there’s a famous brewery there, interestingly) caught thousands of ladybeetles in their light trap…and that’s when it became apparent there was a new invasive strain in the US.

        <p>
            <i>The Multicolored Asian Ladybeetle</i> has been useful in controlling pests in a number of crops, namely pecans, pines, and soybeans. They’re a very hardy ladybug, and can often withstand pesticides better than their prey can. They’re good at avoiding predators, but there are things which eat them. They’ll also eat a lot of different bugs, from aphids to ladybirds.

          However, at the same time, these insects themselves are pests as well. They’re well recognized household pests, and we get dozens of emails about them every fall and spring because that’s when they’re around people. However, on farms, they’re also problematic because they can mix in with fruit and ruin the taste of fruit juices with their defensive chemicals. They also eat the fruit before winter, which opens up the fruit to contamination from other stuff. They’re particularly damaging in the wine industry, where their characteristic flavor has been given the name <b><i>‘ladybug taint’</i></b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span id="uppercase"> For now… </span> it appears that invasive ladybirds aren’t as large of a factor in the decline of native ladybug species.
