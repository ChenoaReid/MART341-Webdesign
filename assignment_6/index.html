<h2>
  Ingredients
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li> 8 cups of All-Purpose Flour
    <li> 4 Tbsp. of Baking Powder
    <li> 4 1/2 tsp. of salt
    <li> 1/8 cup of Honey
    <li> 6-8 cups of Warm Water
    <li> 1 Liter of Canola Oil (Or Shortening)
</ul>

<h2>
  Directions
  </h2>

  <p>
    Mix dry ingredients <b>(Flour, Baking Power and Salt)</b> by hand in a large bowl.
    </p>
  <p>
    Drizzle the <b>Honey</b> into the bottom of a glass 8-cup measuring cup. Add very warm water into the cup and mix the <b>Honey</b> until disolved.
    </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> <i>When humidity is high, use less water. </i>
  <p> Do not overhandle when kneeding the bread dough. The consistancy needs to remain soft and slightly sticky.
    </p>
  <p> Cover and let dough rest for 1.5-2 hours.

  <h3>
    Frying the Dough
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Pre-heat stove-top to 350F (175C) and add your shortening or oil to a deep pan or pot.
        </li>
      <li> With floured hands, shape about 1/2 cup of dough into 1-inch patties. Create a hole in the middle for consistant frying.
        </li>
      <li> Gently lower one piece at a time into the hot oil, waiting 1-2 minutes on each side until golden brown.
        </li>
      <li> Place the fresh Frybread onto a surface that can drain or absorb excess oil.
    </ol>
