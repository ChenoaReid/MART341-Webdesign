What does the lyrical context mean?
  1. "What's the time Mr Wolf?" Is in referance to the childrens game.
     * You call and run towards them.
     * If they turn while you run, you get “eaten” and lose.

  2. "..you're blind, you bleat, you bare your claws." refers to the idiom of a wolf in sheep's clothing
     * Bleating of a sheep can be misleading an innocent
     * While baring claws are features of the deceptive wolf.
