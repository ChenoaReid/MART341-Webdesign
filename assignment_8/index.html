        <h1>Lyrics</h1>
        <p> There's a second wind coming as we lie here in our bed <br />
        It rattles the bones of our fathers, carries whispers from the dead <br />
        And you, you, you light a candle <br />
        And I make sure the bairns are fed </p>

        <p> You turn the telly on to drown out your fear <br />
        You make the bed up silent on the floor, so no one will hear us <br />
        You try so loud to love me <br />
        I cannot seem to hear </p>

        <p>'Cause you, you touch, my skin peels off like paint <br />
        But beneath all of our panting, there's this noise I cannot shake <br />
        Well, can't you hear that scratching? <br />
        There's something at the door <br />
        But the wind has picked us up now, we're hanging in the air <br />
        And as you grip me like an animal that you're about to spear <br />
        "Be good to me, " I whisper <br />
        And you say, "What?" and I say, "Nothing, dear" <br />
        Can't you hear it? <br />
        It can hear you <br />
        It wants me to </p>

        <p>(Throw the plate at the wall)</p>

        <p> I'm the paper cut that kills you and the priest that you ignored <br />
        I'm the touch you crave, I'm the plans that you made <br />
        But fuck all your plans, I'm bored <br />
        "And can't you hear that scratching?" I ask your eyes </p>

        <p> I've got knuckle burn from typing all these lines into your chest <br />
        And as the belt from your buckle is tightening <br />
        I make shipwrecks out of my dress <br />
        And the door below, it splinters, and the creature creeps inside </p>

        <p> And we fall into each other, the scratching grows so loud <br />
        Because that unwanted animal wants nothing more than to get out <br />
        And I scream, "What's the time, Mr. Wolf?" <br />
        But you, you're blind, you bleat, you bear your claws </p>

        <p> Oh, and you rip my ribcage open and devour what's truly yours <br />
        And our screaming joins in unison, I cry out to the Lord <br />
        'Cause if we join our hands in prayer enough <br />
        To God, I imagine it all starts to sound like applause </p>

        <p> Can't you hear it? <br />
        It can hear you <br />
        It wants me to </p>

        <p> And these plates, they smash like waves (place your hand in mine) <br />
        And on the wind, it howls (how long can this last?) <br />
        'Cause that second wind is coming, love, it's coming for all we own <br />
        And on the creature scratches, it doesn't know how to get out (let me out!) </p>

        <p> And you, you follow philosophies, but me, I laugh, I choke <br />
        "Well, hello, my hollow Holofernes" <br />
        I wink, but you don't get the joke <br />
        "Hold the hand of the god-child, " they said, "as he falls from the sky" <br />
        "Be good to me, " I beg of him <br />
        "Be good to me, " I beg of him <br />
        Be good, be good, be good, be good, be good, be good, be good <br />
        And he replies (oh), "No, no, not I" </p>
