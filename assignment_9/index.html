    <h2>Tips for a Better Tabletop Podcast Experience</h2>
    <div>
        <h2>Resources to Begin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio Recording
                <ul>
                    <li>For actualplay-multiperson recording: ensure you have good quality mics for each individual.</li>
                    <li>Utilize a soundboard for to connect each microphone. </li>
                    <li>I recommend each cast member wear headphones that are connected to the audio output so they can hear themselves during the recording. </li>
                    <li> <b>Note:</b> If recording remotely each person should have a good quality mic, be in a quiet space and wear headphones to avoid echo. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Audio and Editing Software
                <ul>
                    <li>Mix with: WavePad</li>
                    <li>Record with: Reaper</li>
                    <li>Edit with: Audacity</li>
                    <li>Each of these programs are easily accessable and free to use</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>#1. Comparing Quality Audio</h2>
        <!-- This is the audio track saved localy in different media types-->
        <div id="audio" class="container">
            <h1>Early Audio on Single Track Recording</h1>
            <audio preload controls>
                <source src=".\media\E02.01B" type="audo/mpeg" >
                 <source src=".\media\E02.01B.wav" type="audio/wav">
                <p> Early Bloopers from <b> The Emergence Podcast </b> </p>
                <p> Your browser does not support this audio</p>
            </audio>
            <p> Notice in the earlier bloopers version of <b> The Emergence Podcast </b> the audio quality echos and contains white noise. The players are often heard at difference volumes as well. </p>
        </div>
        <!-- This is the audio track saved localy in different media types-->
        <div id="audio" class="container">
            <h1>Recent Audio on Multi-Track Recording</h1>
            <audio preload controls>
                <source src=".\media\E03.03 (1).mp3" type="audo/mpeg" >
                 <source src=".\media\E03.03 (1).wav" type="audio/wav">
                <p> Recent Bloopers from <b> The Emergence Podcast </b> </p>
                <p> Your browser does not support this audio</p>
            </audio>
            <p> Now listening to later versions of bloopers from <b> The Emergence Podcast </b> the quality is crisper and echo is reduced. We are able to isolate individual recording tracks and more <br>
               accurately edit and adjust volume. </br>
             </p>
        </div>
    <div>
        <h2>#2. Creating Thumbnails and Logos</h2>
        <img src="./images/IMG_0480.PNG" width="200" height = "200"><img src="./images/IMG_0338.PNG" width="200" height="200"><img src="./images/IMG_0481.PNG" width="200" height="200">
        <p>Logos are an important tool to brand your content. Make it something recognizable and simplistic with multiple variations. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Making a Logo should be cohesive and have an appealing color scheme.</li>
            <li>Notice each variation contains the same design or text, but is different enough that a brand can use each variation interchangably.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./images/Wastes.png" width="200" height = "200"><img src="./images/Feuri.png" width="200" height = "200"><img src="./images/IMG_0762.png" width="200" height = "200">
        <p> Thumbnails for our podcasts follow a few rules: They each should have a recognizable title and is designed in a similar style. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our Thumbnails all have a signature lineless art style that is recognizable and consistant</li>
            <li>Notice each variation feels like a DICEBERG Ahead! Thumbnail because the style and text can be grouped with other podcast titles.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>#3. Producing a Finished Episode</h2>
        <img src="./images/Capture.JPG" alt="Libsyn Upload" width="471" height="250">
        <p>Creating Finished content can be tedious, however there are a few simple reminders when recording and editing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Its exteremely Important</b> to enforce good mic etiquette when recording. You should be able to hear eachother clearly while also avoiding pops in speech or disruptive noise.</li>
            <li>Always double check that you are recording correctly throughout each session and save in multiple places.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to record extra production content like outros, promotions or introductions to your podcast. </li>
            <li>When editing in <b> Audacity</b> keep your tracks organized</li>
            <li>Once Exported, gather your Title, thumbnail and MP3 file and upload it to your chosen Podcast distribution platform <i> Like Libsyn</i> </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>#4. Marketing on Social Media</h2>

        </video>
        <p>Posting content regularly to multiple social media platforms is the key way for people to discover your podcasts</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use websites like <b>Kapwing</b> or <b>Reel</b> to create snapshots of an episode or outtakes. </li>
            <li>Even though podcasts are primarily an audio medium, visual aspects for socials is a must.</li>

            <li>Aside from what you post, there should also be interactions and conversations with your audience or other creators to further your networking.</li>
