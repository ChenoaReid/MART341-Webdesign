            <h2>Why did you choose this topic?</h2>
            <p> Podcasting has been a very important creative outlet for me and many of my friends for over 4 years. We started recording our tabletop sessions back in 2019, mostly as a tool to keep track of events that happened in game. However, after listening back too our antics - - we ultimately decided it was too good to keep to ourselves.

            <h2>What does it mean for you?</h2>
            <p>Recording for podcasts, multiple ones at that, really gave me skills to organize and produce a product that I can be proud of on a creative level. Most of the players and Game Masters enjoy the simple aspect of having fun with friends and how that can impact an audience.
